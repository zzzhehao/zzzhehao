# ðŸ¦‘ Hi!

I am a M.Sc. Biology Student at University of Hamburg. I use coding power to assist my work in my professions. 

I do cool stuff and nerd stuff with `R`.

## Random Project

**M42 (Orion Nebula)** - Used processing power to compensate low SNR acquisition since I did not use EQ mount to track object. Stacked from 2000 frames per 0.5 s exposure for total 16 minutes exposure time. This is the best I can get before blowing up my storage and processor.
